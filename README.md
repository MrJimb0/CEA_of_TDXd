You will find the following files: 
  A plotting file 
  The PSA file that pulls from the 7-state transition property file, 8-state transition property file, and CEA base case file 
  The base case CEA that is used for generating graphs 
  The appendix explains in detail why there are 7 and 8 state transition files. Briefly, we use the 7 state to derive the final transition rate (from the terminal to dead) used in the 8 state model.
